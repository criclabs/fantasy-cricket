<h2>Welcome to the Helperby Fantasy Cricket Club App! </h2>

<p>The idea of the fantasy team is to let players and friends
of our club pick who they think will perform well, consistently over the
season. We have seen the idea circulating around a few clubs in the area and it
has not only performed well, but it has raised money for the Cricket Club
itself. </p>

<h2>Competition Rules</h2>

<p>Anyone may enter. Entry is <b>£10</b> per adult or <b>£5</b> for juniors.</p>

<p>All points are allocated according to the result sheet that
Helperby posts to the Nidderdale League website. The administrator is not
liable for the information that is not entered or is entered incorrectly. </p>

<p>Points are awarded to all players participating in any Senior Saturday fixture. </p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>

<p>The Fantasy Cricket App was set up as a fundraising scheme for the club. 50% of the money raised will go towards club funds.  <b>30% of the money will go to the
winner of the competition!</b> 10% will go to second place, and 5% to third place. The remaining 5% will cover administration costs associated with the website.
</p>

<h2>How do I start a team?</h2>

<p>Anyone may log on to the website to view the League table,
but to create a team you need a specially generated code, obtainable from Tom Messenger. </p>

<p>
Once you have logged on you can create your team and pick players.  You are allocated a certain amount of "Team Cash" with which to purchase your team members.  The price of each player depends on their performance in the previous season, ranging from £4.5m to £15m.  You have to pick 11 players according to the rules below, nominate one player as captain, one player as keeper, and you have to Validate your team.  Your captain will score double points for your team.  Your keeper will gain points for batting, but not for bowling (since he is keeping).  Once the team has been validated, you are ready for the game. </p>

<h2>Rules for making a team</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Teams must consist of 11 players.</li>
	<li>Only a limited amount of Team Cash is available to purchase players.</li>
	<li>All teams must have a minimum of 2 juniors in the side. The
juniors may be in any desired playing position.</li>
	<li>Each team must have: 3 batsmen, 3 bowlers and 3 all-rounders.</li>
	<li>One team member must be nominated as the captain.  He scores double.</li>
	<li>One team member must be nominated as the keeper.  This team member will not
	    collect any points from bowling.</li>
	<li>Each team will be allowed to make 1 substitution per week. This is done by dropping a player, adding a new player and then re-validating the team.</li>
	<li>When substitutions are made, the points that the exiting player has accrued up until that date, will remain with the team. The incoming player will then start gaining points from that date. Points earned before being selected will not be transferred over.</li>
	<li>Substitutions must be made before 23:59 on the Friday. </li>
	<li>Special rules will apply in the case of abandonned matches. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules Of The Game</h2>

score the most points over the season. You can check your team's progress and ranking in the League Table.  Points are scored as follows:</p>

		<li>1 Duck = -10 Points</li>
	</ol>
<li>Bowlers:</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>1 Wicket = 15 Points</li>
